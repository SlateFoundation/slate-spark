# Sparkpoints

Sparkpoints are learning standards optimized for Spark and optionally mapped to public standards for one or more jurisdiction.
Inspired by [Cross-Jurisdiction Mapping (Intermediary Services) as described by ASN](http://www.achievementstandards.org/content/how-asn-works),
Sparkpoints enable Spark-powered schools to share learning content and a framework for personalized curriculum across state
lines while still being able to report student achievement in terms of local standards.
